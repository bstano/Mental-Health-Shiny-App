# Mental Health and the 2020 National Health Interview Survey: An Examination of the Factors Related to Anxiety and Depression Among US Adults

### App Purpose

This app is intended as a tool for health care professionals and administrators seeking a better understanding of select demographic, health care access, exercise, and food security-related factors that contribute to severe anxiety and depression. Second, it is designed as a resource for designers, administrators, and others involved with the National Health Interview Survey to allow them to better digest, visualize, model, and understand the data they've helped collect in a clearer format. And third, this app was developed as a mechanism through which the statistics-educated general public interested in learning more about mental health in the United States can gain a better sense of the attributes that tend to be associated with severe anxiety and depression. 
The app consists of an introduction tab, which explains the general framework of the 2020 National Health Interview Survey and the subset of data used in the app; an EDA tab, in which users can observe the distribution of each variable, whether factor or numeric, and the extent to which the question was answered by the more than 30,000 subjects; a dependence/significance testing tab in which relationships between variables are visualized and then tested for significance in differences of means (ANOVA), dependence (chi square), or correlation depending on the class of variable; a logistic regression tab, in which users built models predicting severe anxiety or depression and observe the summary output of that model; a classification tree tab, in which users build and visualize tree models, again predicting severe anxiety or depression; a random forest tab, in which the variables are plotted by their "importance" in predicting the outcome variable of either severe anxiety or depression; and a data dictionary, in which definitions, levels, and transformations for each variable can be more easily understood.
